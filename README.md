# Hello!

Welcome! This repository stores the workflow of the research paper 'Current and future conflicts between solar photovoltaic energy infrastructures and sandgrouse distributions' (on process) by Benítez-López et al., a work conducted by Laura Maeso Pueyo.
Below is an overview of the folders included in this repository.

## Folder Structure

### `data/`
This folder contains base datasets used in the project. It may include raw data, cleaned data, and any relevant data files necessary for analysis or model training.

### `objects/`
This folder contains some generated intermediate objects in the workflow .

### `results/`
This folder contains the output of analyses, including figures, tables, and any other results generated during the project. 

### `scripts/`
This folder holds all the scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Script 01 and 08 can't be run due to the large size of the processed files, small ASCII/CSV files are generated in both scripts so that all the other scripts can be run. 

### `spatial_data/`
This folder contains spatial data used in the project. Many of the files could not be uploaded due to their huge size but all filenames and sources can be found in 'spatial_data/files.txt'.
